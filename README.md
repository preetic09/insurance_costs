The purpose of this project is to understand whether several factors including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region have an impact on insurance costs. I looked at each variable and its relationships by creating a detailed statistical analysis of the data through R. Statistical methods that I used for this project are:
 - F-test for Simple Linear Regression
 - Two-sample t test for compare difference of two means
 - ANOVA Test, for the comparing of two or more population's means
